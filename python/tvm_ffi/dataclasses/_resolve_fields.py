"""Forward-annotation resolution for ``@py_class`` registration.

``@py_class`` registers a Python type before it resolves field annotations, so
self-referential and mutually recursive annotations can refer to classes that
are already present in the FFI type registry.  This module owns that early
registration step, the per-module local namespace used by
``typing.get_type_hints``, and the queue of classes whose annotations must be
retried after later definitions become available.

When a class is ready to finalize, this module lazily imports
``py_class.on_fields_resolved``.  Keeping the finalizer import local preserves
the boundary between annotation resolution and field registration while avoiding
a top-level import cycle.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``@py_class`` registration happens in two phases:
#
#   Phase 1 (register_type_without_fields)
#       Allocates a C-level type index and inserts the class into the
#       global type registry.  This must happen early so that self-
#       referential and mutually-referential annotations can resolve
#       the class via ``TypeSchema.from_annotation()``.  Phase 1 always
#       succeeds or raises immediately for invalid parents.  Decorator
#       options are stored by py_class.py on ``TypeInfo._decorator_args``.
#
#   Phase 2 (py_class.on_fields_resolved)
#       Resolves string annotations via ``typing.get_type_hints``,
#       returns per-owner resolved hints, and asks py_class.py to
#       materialize ``Field`` objects, register fields/methods/type
#       attributes with the Cython layer, and install dataclass dunders.
#
#       If ``get_type_hints`` raises ``NameError`` (forward reference
#       not yet defined), the class is added to ``_PENDING_CLASSES``
#       and retried after each successful phase-2.  If phase-2 fails
#       for any other reason, ``rollback_registration`` undoes phase-1
#       so the type key can be reused.
