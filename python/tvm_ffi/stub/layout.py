"""Native-layout classification for ``tvm-ffi-stubgen``.

A generator for a language with native structs can hold a reflected object *by
value* only when it can reproduce the object's memory layout byte for byte. The
registry publishes what the compiler computed: each type's own ``sizeof``
(:attr:`.ObjectInfo.total_size`) and every reflected field's size, alignment and
offset. One criterion decides the question:

    The reflected fields must fill ``[parent.total_size, total_size)`` exactly,
    allowing only the gaps alignment forces.

The cursor starts at the parent's size; each field, by ascending offset, must
start at ``align_up(cursor, field.alignment)``; at the end
``align_up(cursor, alignment)`` must equal ``total_size``, where ``alignment`` is
the largest alignment along the chain, the header's included. Two facts must
exist before the criterion can be evaluated: the type needs metadata of its own
(a type without an ``ObjectDef`` inherits its parent's entry, whose size says
nothing about it) and its parent must itself be complete. Nothing else is a
rule: a class with a vptr, for instance, reports offsets relative to the
``TVMFFIObject`` header while its ``sizeof`` is absolute, so its fields can never
fill the region.

``opaque`` is a normal, final verdict: a generator still emits a wrapper and
reaches the fields through the C ABI. Two target-language rules are injected by
the caller instead of living here: a field-renderability predicate, and a set of
semantic vetoes for types that must never be allocated outside their runtime.

The coverage report fixes the language-neutral keys of each entry; a generator
adds its own facts under a per-type ``"target"`` key.
