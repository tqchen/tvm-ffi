        orc_rt : str or Path or bytes or None
            Which ORC runtime to install. Linux/ELF only — ignored on macOS and
            Windows, which never configure an ORC platform.

            - ``"auto"`` (default): the runtime embedded in this extension.
            - a path (``str`` or ``Path``): a custom liborc_rt archive on disk.
            - ``bytes``: a custom liborc_rt archive held in memory.
            - ``None``: no ORC platform at all.

            A custom runtime (path or bytes) must match the LLVM/compiler-rt this
            extension was built against; ``"auto"`` is almost always what you want.
        slab_size : int
            Per-slab capacity in bytes for the JIT memory manager. Linux only —
            ignored on macOS and Windows, where the slab allocator is compiled
            out. 0 = arch default (64 MB; initial slab halves on mmap failure
            down to 8 MB under RLIMIT_AS / container limits), >0 = custom size,
            <0 = disable slab allocator (LLJIT uses its default scattered-mmap
            allocator).

            The session holds a growable pool of slabs: a fresh slab is mmap'd
            on demand when no existing one can fit a graph. Graphs that don't
            fit a normal slab trigger a power-of-2 larger slab (slab_size,
            2*slab_size, ...) sized to fit. Drained slabs stay mapped until the

        Parameters
        ----------
        objects : str or Path or bytes or bytearray, or a sequence of them
            Object files to load, given as paths and/or in-memory object-file
            images. A single item is accepted as shorthand for a one-element list.
        name : str
            Optional name for the underlying library. Auto-generated if empty.
        keep_module_alive : bool
            If True, pin the module in the runtime's process-global registry
            (see Notes). Defaults to False.
        cxx : str or None
            C++ compiler command whose runtime should resolve symbols in these
            objects on Linux. Defaults to ``$CXX``, or ``c++`` when unset,
            matching :func:`tvm_ffi.cpp.build`. The compiler is queried once
            for its shared libstdc++ and optional ``libstdc++_nonshared.a``;
            no runtime path needs to be supplied. Ignored on other platforms.

        Returns
        -------
        Module
            A :class:`tvm_ffi.Module` whose imports and library context are fully
            wired.

        Notes
        -----
        ``keep_module_alive`` mirrors :func:`tvm_ffi.load_module`'s option of
        the same name. When True, the module is inserted into the runtime's
        process-global module registry, so its JITDylib — and every function
        pointer, deleter, and static allocation it owns — stays mapped until
        the interpreter unloads ``libtvm_ffi``. Use this when Objects produced
        by the module may outlive the local ``mod`` reference (e.g., a
        JIT-allocated ``String`` or ``Array`` returned to Python and held past
        ``del mod``). When False (default), the caller owns the module's
        lifetime and its JIT memory is reclaimed on drop; callers must ensure
        no JIT-produced Object outlives the returned module.

        Pinning is transitive: the module holds a strong reference to its
        :class:`ExecutionSession`, so pinning one module also keeps that
        session (and its slab-pool memory manager) alive for the process
        lifetime. Reclaim is slab-granular — a slab shared between a pinned
        and an unpinned module stays mapped until the pinned module is gone.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> session = default_session()
        >>> mod = session.load_module(["a.o", "b.o", Path("c.o").read_bytes()])
        >>> mod.my_function(1, 2)
